# Web_scrapping_React
I developed a web application that scrapes website content into PDFs, HTML snapshots, and screenshots using Puppeteer for automation. The data, along with scrape timestamps, is stored in MongoDB for retrieval and download. The frontend interface allows users to input URLs and select desired formats with ease.
